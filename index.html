                <h1>Common Laptop Problems</h1>
                <p>Laptops are the most convenient to use but just like any other electronic device, laptops may begin
                    to
                    show
                    signs of failure too with regular use. Some common problems that often arise in a laptop include:
                </p>
                <aside>
                    <h3>Laptop Screen Doesn't Turn On</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If your laptop keeps turning off every few minutes and doesn't turn on, there is a high
                            chance
                            that the AC adapter has malfunctioned.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There is also a possibility that the DC power jack may have broken. Before getting a laptop
                            service scheduled, try adjusting the plug's angle in its jack and it should save you from
                            laptop
                            repair. If that doesn't help it's an indication of a motherboard issue. You will need to
                            schedule a laptop service to get the motherboard repaired or replaced.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you notice lines on your laptop screen, it may be a result of a hardware failure or due
                            to
                            damage to the screen. This doesn't really indicate a laptop screen repair. Unplug your
                            laptop,
                            hold the power button for 30 seconds and restart the laptop. If this doesn't help, you will
                            need
                            to be prepared for a laptop service.

                    <h3>Laptop Has Slowed Down</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Laptops usually slow down when there are too many files and programs saved on it, as a
                            result of
                            regular use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To avoid this problem and any further laptop repair, free up some space on the hard drive by
                            deleting temporary files and keeping your desktop organized.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You could also transfer old files to an external hard drive to improve your laptop's
                            performance.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </aside>
                <aside>
                    <h3>Automatically Shuts Down</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This is most likely due to overheating, which is usually caused due to dust build-up in the
                            case
                            and around the fan.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Switch off the laptop and clean it thoroughly to get rid of the dust. The simplest way to do
                            this is to blow air into the side vent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If this doesn't help, start using a cooling fan.
                        </li>

                    <h3>Battery Drains Quickly</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If your laptop's battery drains out quickly, reduce the number of open tasks. This puts an
                            additional drain on the battery.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Avoid keeping multiple windows open and disable the Bluetooth option to avoid draining your
                            laptop battery further.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Also, switch on the 'Energy Saving' mode and keep the brightness low. These tips can help
                            you
                            save money on laptop repair.

                        <li>
                            Check if the airplane mode on your laptop is switched off and Wi-Fi is switched on.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Re-install drivers of the network adapter.
